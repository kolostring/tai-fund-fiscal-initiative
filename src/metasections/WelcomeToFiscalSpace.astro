        It is past time to address the fiscal blindspot and scale up support
        for more sustainable public financing that can better serve
        development needs. In 2025, the 4th International Conference on
        Financing for Development (FfD4) will set the development finance
        agenda for the next decade. Decisions will impact countries’ ability
        to invest in development and climate responses. Thus, TAI set up a
        Fund Fiscal project to increase funders’ investment and engagement
        in fiscal issues. We and focused on philanthropies and support to
        civil society based on given our needs assessment.
