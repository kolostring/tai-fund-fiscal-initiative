        It is past time to address the fiscal blindspot and scale up support for
        more sustainable public financing that can better serve development
        needs. In 2025, the 4th International Conference on Financing for
        Development (FfD4) will set the development finance agenda for the next
        decade. Decisions will impact countries’ ability to invest in
        development and climate responses. Thus, TAI set up a Fund Fiscal
        project to increase funders’ investment and engagement in fiscal issues.
        We and focused on philanthropies and support to civil society based on
        given our needs assessment.
