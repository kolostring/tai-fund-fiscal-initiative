          Today, the world faces a $4 trillion financing gap to achieve the
          Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). That cannot come from aid alone.
          Most must be raised by the countries themselves. Governments need to
          create more fiscal space, defined by the International Monetary Fund
          (IMF) as the room in a government’s budget to fund national
          priorities, such as education or climate adaptation, without
          jeopardizing the sustainability of its fiscal position or the
          stability of the economy.
        </span>
        <span>
          As the IMF explains, governments can create fiscal space by raising
          taxes, securing outside grants, cutting expenditures, borrowing
          resources (from citizens or foreign lenders), or borrowing from the
          banking system (thereby expanding the money supply).
        </span>
        <span>
          At the same time, governments need to consider who bears the costs of
          reforms. Austerity measures that cut spending to service debts
          typically hit the poorest the hardest, deepening inequality.

          Negotiations are underway for the Fourth International Financing for
          Development Conference (FfD4) – a once-in-a-decade process guided by
          the United Nations (UN). FfD4 will set the agenda for mobilizing
          funding for today’s pressing development needs through taxation,
          borrowing, and international assistance.
