        Today, the world faces a $4 trillion financing gap to achieve the
        Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). That cannot come from aid alone.
        Most must be raised by the countries themselves. Governments need to
        create more fiscal space, defined by the International Monetary Fund
        (IMF) as the room in a government’s budget to fund national priorities,
        such as education or climate adaptation, without jeopardizing the
        sustainability of its fiscal position or the stability of the economy. 
        As the IMF explains, governments can create fiscal space by raising
        taxes, securing outside grants, cutting expenditures, borrowing
        resources (from citizens or foreign lenders), or borrowing from the
        banking system (thereby expanding the money supply).  At the same time,
        governments need to consider who bears the costs of reforms. Austerity
        measures that cut spending to service debts typically hit the poorest
        the hardest, deepening inequality.  Negotiations are underway for the
        Fourth International Financing for Development Conference (FfD4) – a
        once-in-a-decade process guided by the United Nations (UN). FfD4 will
        set the agenda for mobilizing funding for today’s pressing development
        needs through taxation, borrowing, and international assistance.
